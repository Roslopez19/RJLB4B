Mis Canciones Favoritas: <br>
1. Set Fire To The Rain <br>
LETRA: <br>
<br>
I let it fall, my heart<br>
And as it fell, you rose to claim it<br>
It was dark, and I was over<br>
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me<br>
My hands, they were strong<br>
But my knees were far too weak<br>
To stand in your arms<br>
Without falling to your feet<br>
<br>
But there's a side to you<br>
That I never knew, never knew<br>
All the things you'd say<br>                                                                       
They were never true, never true<br>
And the games you'd play<br>
You would always win, always win<br>
<br>
But I set fire to the rain<br>
Watched it pour as I touched your face<br>
Well, it burned while I cried<br>
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name<br>
Your name<br>
<br>
When I lay with you<br>
I could stay there, close my eyes<br>
Feel you here forever<br>
You and me together, nothing gets better<br>
<br>
'Cause there's a side to you<br>
That I never knew, never knew<br>
All the things you'd say<br>
They were never true, never true<br>
And the games you'd play<br>
You would always win, always win<br>
<br>
But I set fire to the rain<br>
Watched it pour as I touched your face<br>
Well, it burned while I cried<br>
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name<br>
Your name<br>
<br>
I set fire to the rain<br>
And I threw us into the flames<br>
When we fell, something died<br>
'Cause I knew that that was the last time<br>
The last time<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wake up by the door<br>
That heart you caught must be waiting for you<br>
Even now, when we're already over<br>
I can't help myself from looking for you<br>
<br>
I set fire to the rain<br>
Watched it pour as I touched your face<br>
Well, it burned while I cried<br>
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name<br>
Your name<br>
<br>
I set fire to the rain<br>
And I threw us into the flames<br>
When we fell, something died<br>
'Cause I knew that that was the last time<br>
The last time<br>
<br>
Oh, oh, no<br>
Let it burn<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
Let it burn<br>
Let it burn<br>
<br>

2. Rolling In The Deep <br>
<br>
There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark<br>
Finally, I can see you crystal clear<br>
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare<br>
<br>
See how I'll leave with every piece of you<br>
Don't underestimate the things that I will do<br>
<br>
There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark<br>
<br>
The scars of your love remind me of us<br>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless<br>
I can't help feeling<br>
<br>
We could've had it all<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
And you played it to the beat<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
Baby, I have no story to be told<br>
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn<br>
Think of me in the depths of your despair<br>
Making home down there, as mine sure won't be shared<br>
<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
The scars of your love remind me of us<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
I can't help feeling<br>
<br>
We could've had it all<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
And you played it to the beat<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
We could've had it all<br>
Rolling in the deep<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>
But you played it with a beating<br>
<br>
Throw your soul through every open door<br>
Count your blessings to find what you look for<br>
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold<br>
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow<br>
<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
We could've had it all<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
We could've had it all<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
It all, it all, it all<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
We could've had it all<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
And you played it to the beat<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
Could've had it all<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
<br>
But you played it<br>
You played it<br>
You played it<br>
You played it to the beat<br>
<br>

3. All I Ask <br>
<br>
I will leave my heart at the door<br>
I won't say a word<br>
They've all been said before, you know<br>
So why don't we just play pretend<br>
Like we're not scared of what's coming next<br>
Or scared of having nothing left?<br>
<br>
Look, don't get me wrong<br>
I know there is no tomorrow<br>
All I ask is<br>
<br>
If this is my last night with you<br>
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend<br>
Give me a memory I can use<br>
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do<br>
It matters how this ends<br>
'Cause what if I never love again?<br>
<br>
I don't need your honesty<br>
It's already in your eyes<br>
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me<br>
No one knows me like you do<br>
And since you're the only one that mattered<br>
Tell me, who do I run to?<br>
<br>
Look, don't get me wrong<br>
I know there is no tomorrow<br>
All I ask is<br>

If this is my last night with you<br>
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend<br>
Give me a memory I can use<br>
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do<br>
It matters how this ends<br>
'Cause what if I never love again?<br>
<br>
Let this be our lesson in love<br>
Let this be the way we remember us<br>
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious<br>
And I ain't asking for forgiveness<br>
All I ask is<br>
<br>
If this is my last night with you<br>
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend<br>
Give me a memory I can use<br>
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do<br>
It matters how this ends<br>
'Cause what if I never love again?<br>

4. Hello <br>
<br>
Hello, it's me<br>
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
To go over everything<br>
They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br>
But I ain't done much healing<br>
<br>
Hello, can you hear me?<br>
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
When we were younger and free<br>
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br>
There's such a difference between us<br>
And a million miles<br>
<br>
Hello from the other side<br>
I must've called a thousand times<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
But when I call, you never seem to be home<br>
Hello from the outside<br>
At least I can say that I've tried<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br>
<br>
Hello, how are you?<br>
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br>
I hope that you're well<br>
Did you ever make it out of that town<br>
Where nothing ever happened?<br>
It's no secret that the both of us<br>
Are running out of time<br>
<br>
So hello from the other side (other side)<br>
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
But when I call, you never seem to be home<br>
Hello from the outside (outside)<br>
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br>
<br>
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)<br>
Ooh, anymore<br>
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)<br>
Ooh, anymore<br>
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)<br>
Ooh, anymore<br>
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)<br>
Anymore<br>
<br>
Hello from the other side (other side)<br>
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
But when I call, you never seem to be home<br>
Hello from the outside (outside)<br>
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br>

5. Someone Like You<br>
<br>
I heard that you're settled down<br>
That you found a girl and you're married now<br>
I heard that your dreams came true<br>
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you<br>
<br>
Old friend<br>
Why are you so shy?<br>
It ain't like you to hold back<br>
Or hide from the light<br>
<br>
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited<br>
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it<br>
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded<br>
That for me, it isn't over<br>
<br>
Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you, too<br>
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah<br>
<br>
You know how the time flies<br>
Only yesterday was the time of our lives<br>
We were born and raised in a summer haze<br>
Bound by the surprise of our glory days<br>
<br>
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited<br>
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it<br>
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded<br>
That for me, it isn't over<br>
<br>
Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you, too<br>
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah<br>
<br>
Nothing compares, no worries or cares<br>
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made<br>
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?<br>
<br>
Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you<br>
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead<br>
<br>
Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you, too<br>
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah, yeah<br>
